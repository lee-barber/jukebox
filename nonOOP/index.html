<!-- Jukebox Starter Kit Workshop: Individual

Goal:  Demonstrate understanding of objects in JavaScript.

Assignment:  This Starter Kit workshop is designed for you to create the foundation for your next project! You've had a bit of time to get familiar with object oriented JavaScript. Now letâ€™s build a Jukebox!

You will build a music player that will end up playing any mp3 you can find online. Think about what functionality you might need for this to work. Encapsulate all of this functionality in a JavaScript object so that starting a song is as simple as calling Jukebox.play() You need an array of song objects and the ability to play, stop and pause a song. How would you switch songs? Can you shuffle songs? Focus on getting the JavaScript to work and keep the HTML/CSS minimal, make it work before you make it look good!

Before you Begin:  Read through this tutorial describing how to use html5 audio (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and control playback using javascript.

Your JavaScript Jukebox should:

-Display at least one song on the page when the page loads
-Give the user the ability to play that song, without using the "built-in" play button. This could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.
-Give the user the ability to stop that song without using the "built-in" stop button. Once again, this could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.
-Give the user the ability to load at least one different song into the Jukebox besides the one that is loaded when the page initially renders
-The whole Jukebox should be backed by an object called Jukebox with methods to play, stop, and load songs.

Extra Challenge:

-Playlist of songs, allows the user to queue up the next song

-Feature to request a random song

Grading Criteria:

-JS throws no errors
-Pause, Play, and Stop functions work (and do not use built in functionality)
-JukeBox has working Next button. When you get to the end of the songlist JukeBox returns to the first song
-JukeBox is object-oriented -->
